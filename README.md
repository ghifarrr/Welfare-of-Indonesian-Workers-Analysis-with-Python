## INTRODUCTION
Workers' welfare is a critical aspect of a country's social and economic development. In the Indonesian context, an in-depth understanding of the Per-capita Poverty Line, Expenditure, Hourly Workers' Wages, and Provincial Minimum Wage (UMP) is important for designing effective policies to improve the living conditions of workers.

Analyzing data related to the welfare of Indonesian workers involves a deep understanding of economic dynamics, inequality, and income distribution. In this context, datasets covering per capita poverty lines, expenditure, wages, and UMPs from different provinces provide valuable insights.

First of all, the **poverty line per capita analysis** provides a snapshot of the poverty rate in different regions and the extent to which workers in Indonesia can meet their basic needs. The separation between urban and rural areas helps identify disparities that may exist between the two.
**Expenditure analysis** provides a different perspective, illustrating how individual or family expenditure patterns relate to welfare levels. Whether the expenditure reflects basic needs being met or shows inequality in access to resources.
**Average hourly worker wages and Provincial Minimum Wages (UMP)** are the focus of the analysis to understand the extent to which workers in different provinces are fairly compensated. This analysis can help in evaluating wage differences between regions and their implications for welfare levels.

In the course of this analysis, it will also involve exploring relationships between variables, such as the correlation between the poverty line and wages. Regression analysis may be required to understand the factors that can predict the welfare level of workers in Indonesia.

By summarizing these findings, the objective of this analysis of worker welfare is not only to present a comprehensive picture, but also to provide a basis for policymakers to design more effective strategies to improve the living conditions of Indonesian workers. The conclusions and recommendations generated from this analysis can serve as a foundation for better and more sustainable policy improvements in the future.

### Per-capita Poverty Line

The Poverty Line is a representation of the rupiah needed or the price paid so that the population can live a minimum decent life that includes the fulfillment of minimum food needs (equivalent to 2,100 kilocalories per capita per day) and non-food essentials.

The Poverty Line (GK) is obtained from the survey results (sample). The poverty rate released by BPS is macro data and is the result of the Susenas (National Socio-Economic Survey) which shows the percentage of poor people to the total population in a region.

### Average Per-capita Expenditure

Average per capita expenditure is a measure that describes the amount of money spent by a country's population in a given period, generally measured per year. It is one of the important indicators in analyzing the level of economic well-being of a country and the standard of living of its population. Average per capita expenditure reflects the level of economic well-being of a country. The higher the average per capita expenditure, the higher the standard of living in the country.

Average per-capita expenditure is obtained from national statistical agencies (BPS) or household surveys (samples). The average per-capita expenditure figures released by BPS are data collected from respondents in various households randomly selected to participate in the survey. They are asked to provide detailed information about their expenditure over a certain period, which is then processed and calculated to obtain the average per capita expenditure.

### Average Hourly Worker Wage

Average hourly worker wage is the average financial reward given to workers in return for the work they do based on 1 hour of work spent. Hourly workers' wages are calculated by dividing the total wages received by workers in a period by the number of hours worked. Governments can use information on hourly workers' wages to set minimum wage policies, address wage disparities, and improve workers' welfare.

Some countries set a minimum wage, which is the lowest amount of wages that workers are allowed to be paid. Minimum wages aim to protect workers by setting minimum standards that employers must adhere to.
The average hourly wage of workers is obtained from national statistical agencies (BPS) or employers' reports. The average hourly worker wage figures released are obtained by interviewing workers or asking employers to report information on wages paid to workers per hour. Surveys can cover a wide range of economic sectors and worker education or skill levels.

### Provincial Minimum Wage (UMP)

Provincial minimum wage is a minimum wage standard set by the government at the provincial level or provincial-level administrative regions in a country. The provincial minimum wage applies at the provincial level and can differ between provinces within a country.

The purpose of the provincial minimum wage is because it is an important policy instrument to improve workers' conditions and ensure that the wages received by workers are sufficient for living needs at the local level. The setting of the provincial minimum wage takes into account local economic and social conditions to achieve a good balance between workers' rights and economic sustainability.

#### QUESTIONS

- What is the trend of the per capita poverty line in Indonesia over the past few years?
- Is there a significant difference between poverty lines in urban and rural areas?
- Which provinces have the highest and lowest per capita poverty lines?
- How has the pattern of per capita expenditure changed over the years?
- Are there differences in expenditure patterns between urban and rural areas?
- How has the average hourly wage of workers evolved over the years?
- Are there significant differences in average wages between provinces?
- What is the trend of UMP across Indonesian provinces in recent years?
- Are there significant differences in UMP levels between provinces?
- Is there a correlation between the per capita poverty line in urban, rural and rural-urban areas and the average hourly wage of workers?
- Can we use forecasting models to predict future trends in worker welfare?


#### RECOMMENDATIONS

- Strengthen economic empowerment programs that can increase economic empowerment in every province across Indonesia as well as in urban, rural or rural-urban areas, especially those below the poverty line. This could include skills training, education, and better access to decent work.
- Despite improvements, ensure that vulnerable rural areas receive special attention. Targeted programs tailored to the needs of people in these areas can help reduce disparities.
- Engage the private sector in poverty alleviation initiatives. Partnerships with companies can provide employment opportunities, training and financial support to local communities.
- Investigate further the causes of the significant jump in per capita expenditure on 'expenditure' from 2010 to 2011. There may be specific factors such as fiscal policy or economic stimulus that can provide insights for future policy improvements.
- Invest in infrastructure development and education. Good infrastructure can support economic growth, while quality education can improve labor productivity.
- Strengthen policies that can provide special support to workers during an economic or health crisis such as a pandemic, including economic stimulus or assistance programs.
- Consider implementing a minimum wage increase policy in provinces that have low wage values. This can help improve worker welfare and stimulate economic growth in the region.
- Review the impact of a minimum wage increase on productivity and worker welfare, while an increase in minimum wage can increase worker income, companies also need to ensure operational sustainability and productivity.
- While there is a strong positive correlation, it is important to remember that correlation does not necessarily indicate causation. Therefore, it is important to consider other factors that may affect the relationship between wages and the poverty line, such as the cost of living, inflation, and social policies.
- The government should integrate data from various other sources, such as data on inflation rates, unemployment rates, and other economic and social factors to predict future poverty lines using predictive modeling by considering regional differences and involving social factors such as the level of access to education, public health, and existing social programs.
